foolproof-auto-bugtracker
=========================

Trying to visualize my idea for implementing nested try and catch statements for tracking when and what is created the bug

Step number 1:
save exception to database
if save to database fails for example for a crash in db-server

just email the exception to a set developer
If there are any exceptions from emailing, 
save in textfile named with date and time
